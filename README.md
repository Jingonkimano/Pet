This README provides an overview of the project migration process to React and outlines guidelines for ensuring adherence to the main project's design and React structure.

# Introduction
We have decided to migrate our project PetMe to React to leverage its benefits such as component reusability, improved performance, and a vibrant ecosystem. This migration aims to enhance development efficiency, maintainability, and scalability.

## Guidelines for Design Adherence
Maintain Consistency: It is crucial to align the design of the migrated project with the existing design guidelines of the main project. This includes adhering to the color palette, typography, spacing, and overall visual style.

- Study Existing Design Patterns: Familiarize yourself with the design patterns and UI components already used in the main project. Understand how these patterns contribute to the overall user experience. Whenever possible, reuse these components in the migrated project.

## Guidelines for React Structure
- Component-based Architecture: Embrace React's component-based architecture to build modular and reusable UI elements. Divide the project into smaller components that encapsulate specific functionality and follow the Single Responsibility Principle.

- Container and Presentational Components: Separate container components (responsible for fetching data and handling logic) from presentational components (focused on rendering UI). This separation ensures better maintainability and reusability.

- State Management: Utilize a suitable state management solution, such as Redux or React Context, to manage the project's state. Centralize state where necessary, ensuring it follows the project's established conventions.

- Routing: We are using React Router, so organize routes efficiently and maintain consistency with the project routing structure.

- Code Consistency: Adhere to the project coding conventions, such as naming conventions, folder structure, and file organization. Maintain a consistent coding style across the React components to ensure readability and ease of collaboration.

- Testing: Implement unit tests and integration tests for React components to maintain code quality and prevent regressions. Follow the testing framework and methodologies used in the project to ensure consistency.
