I know, I was surprised to find out that a Chihuahua/beagle mix was a thing, too, but lo and behold, the Cheagle is very much a thing. Fall in love with their sweet demeanor and relish in their intelligence: this breed has some of the very best traits of both breeds, including a keen sense of smell and almost human-like intelligence, as well as unbelievable loyalty and affection.

Of course, as you’re researching breeds to bond with, one should be aware of some of the more difficult traits as well. As many Chihuahua owners know, this breed can be quite anxious, which may manifest in different ways. A Cheagle may be seen shaking, barking, and displaying obsessive behaviors like licking or pacing. They can be the proverbial “dog with a bone” when upset.

Another common Chihuahua trait that can be found in Cheagles is that they will often imprint on one person in the family. While Cheagles are perfectly capable of loving multiple people (ours positively screams with excitement when she sees a handful of different folks), they’ll often choose one in particular who is their “person” and “protect” them at all costs.

Their intelligence, small size, and big hearts make Cheagles wonderful family dogs, though you may want to invest in a good pair of earplugs for when the beagle baying makes an appearance!
